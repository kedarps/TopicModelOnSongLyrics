[u'[Verse 1]', u'I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be', u'So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe', u'Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life', u"This ain't easy, it's not meant to be", u'Every story has its scars', u'[Chorus]', u'But when the pain cuts you deep', u'When the night keeps you from sleeping', u'Just look and you will see', u'That I will be your remedy', u'When the world seems so cruel', u'And your heart makes you feel like a fool', u'I promise you will see', u'That I will be, I will be your remedy', u'Ohhh, ohhh', u'[Verse 2]', u'No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you', u"Come whatever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through", u'Your love, it is my truth', u'And I will always love you', u'Love you, love you', u'[Chorus x2]', u'But when the pain cuts you deep', u'When the night keeps you from sleeping', u'Just look and you will see', u'That I will be your remedy', u'When the world seems so cruel', u'And your heart makes you feel like a fool', u'I promise you will see', u'That I will be, I will be your remedy', u'Ohhh, ohhh']
