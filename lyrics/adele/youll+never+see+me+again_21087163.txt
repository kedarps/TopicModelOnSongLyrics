[u'[Verse 1]', u'In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face', u'From the deepest part of my regret', u"I hear the words I wish I'd said", u'At the dawning of the day', u"I can't wait to see the light", u'Make up memories in my head', u"They help to fill the emptiness you've left", u'[Hook]', u"I can't drown in your tears", u"I won't face your fears", u'I need to fight my own', u'[Chorus]', u"You'll never see me again oh baby in time", u'Let the wait take me under', u"I know I'll survive", u"You'll never see me again"]
