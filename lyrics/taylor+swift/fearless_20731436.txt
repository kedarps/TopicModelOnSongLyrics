[u"There's somethin' bout the way", u"The street looks when it's just rained", u"There's a glow off the pavement", u'Walk me to the car', u'And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there', u'In the middle of the parking lot', u'Yeah', u"We're drivin' down the road", u'I wonder if you know', u"I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now", u"But you're just so cool", u'Run your hands through your hair', u"Absent mindedly makin' me want you", u'[Chorus]', u"And I don't know how it gets better than this", u'You take my hand and drag me head first', u'Fearless', u"And I don't know why but with you I'd dance", u'In a storm in my best dress', u'Fearless', u'So baby drive slow', u'Til we run out of road in this one horse town', u"I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat", u'You put your eyes on me', u'In this moment now capture it remember it', u'[Chorus]', u'Well you stood there with me in the doorway', u'my hands shake', u"I'm not usually this way but", u"You pull me in and I'm a little more brave", u"It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something, it's fearless.", u'[Chorus]']
