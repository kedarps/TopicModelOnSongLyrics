[u'At last my love has come along', u'My lonely days are over', u'And life is like a song', u'Oh yeah yeah', u'At last', u'The skies above are blue', u'My heart was wrapped up in clover', u'The night I looked at you', u'I found a dream, that I could speak to', u'A dream that I can call my own', u'I found a thrill to press my cheek to', u'A thrill that I have never known', u'Oh yeah yeah', u'You smile, you smile', u'Oh And then the spell was cast', u'And here we are in heaven', u'For you are mine at last']
