[u'Oh, baby', u'Oh, baby', u'I love the way you make me feel', u'It slows down time', u'Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights', u'You whisper softly in my ear', u'Makes me unwind', u"The way you touch me lets me know you're mine", u'[Chorus]', u"I'd rather be with you 'cause I love the way you scream my name", u"And there's no other man that gives me what I want and makes me feel this way", u"I'd rather be with you 'cause you hustle hard to take care of me", u"I'd rather be with you; boy,I'd rather be with you", u'I love the way you look at me', u'Stare into my eyes', u"What do they say to you? Boy, don't be shy", u"Tonight's the night your fantasies", u'Will all come true', u'I am your woman: I belong to you', u"(There is nothing I won't do for you)", u'I know my soul connected me to you', u"I feel so safe when I'm alone with you", u"(I'm holding back nothing, saving it all for you)", u'Baby, I love making love to you', u"It's like a high I can't come down from you", u'[Chorus]', u"I'd rather be with you, oh yeah", u"Boy, I'd rather be with you", u"I'd rather be with you, oh yeah", u"Boy, I'd rather be with you ", u'[Chorus: x2]']
