[u"I know this isn't what I wanted", u"I never thought it'd come this far", u'Just thinking back to where we started', u'And how we lost all that we are', u'We were young and times were easy', u"But I could see it's not the same", u"I'm standing here but you don't see me", u'Give it all for that to change', u"I don't want", u'To lose her', u"Don't let her go", u'[Chorus]', u'Standing out in the rain', u"Need to know if it's over", u'Cause I would leave you alone', u'Flooded with all this pain', u"Knowing that I'll never hold her", u'Like I did before the storm', u'Yeah', u'Before the storm', u'With every strike of lightening', u'Comes a memory that lasts', u'And not a word is left unspoken', u'As a thunder starts to crash', u'Maybe I should give up', u'[Chorus]', u'Trying to keep', u'The light from going out', u'And the clouds were ripping out my broken heart', u'They always say', u'A heart is not a home', u'Without the one who gets you through the storm', u'[Chorus]']
